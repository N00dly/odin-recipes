        <h2>The Recipe</h2>
            <p>The ultimate recipe for brownies! They're fudgy, moist, and super chocolaty, with perfect crispy edges. From Weeknight Baking by Michelle Lopez.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
         </ul>

         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
            <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>
            Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>
            Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top.</li>
            <li> Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).</li>
            <li> Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.</li>
                <li>
                I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.</li>
                <li>
                When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.</li>
                </ul>
